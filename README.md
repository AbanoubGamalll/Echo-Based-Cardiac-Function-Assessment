# Echo-Based Cardiac Function Assessment <br> `Graduation Project 2024`

- `The goal of this project is to create a sophisticated Deep Learning system that can quickly and accurately evaluate Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF), enhancing the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases.` 
- `Precise LVEF assessment is vital for forecasting the prognosis in conditions such as congestive heart failure, yet existing techniques are often slow and lack precision.`

# Before using this repo
> you can use Kaggle Notebook directly from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/abanoubgamal/gp-notebook"> HERE </a>.

You will need to request access to the 
<a href = 'https://echonet.github.io/dynamic'>EchoNet-Dynamic</a>
dataset from Stanford University. </br>
Once you have access to the data, download it and write the path of the "EchoNet-Dynamic" folder in the _dataRootPath variable in
<a href = "/Model/Paths.py">Paths</a>.
